The problem occurred when users began speculating about the identity of the gunman on 4chan, a controversial anonymous messaging board.
The users named an individual on the Politically Incorrect message board, claiming that the person was a "far left loon" and a "social democrat".
The comments were picked up by several blogs and news sites, including an article by the right-wing political website, the Gateway Pundit.
Many users then searched for the erroneous name on Google. The internet giant's algorithms traced the original source of the story back to the 4chan message board and posted a link to it in the Top Stories section.
"Unfortunately, early this morning we were briefly surfacing an inaccurate 4chan website in our search results for a small number of queries," a Google spokesperson told the BBC.
