This sentencis very good and right because you must belive thet have a good and positive,
something also in a bed situation. I you think so, you succeed in your life. also in a bad situation,
you must think a good and be a good. I have 3, examples from my life: 1 I basketball player I
have alot of games and tugh games. I want a great player. I am alaways think good befor every
game and also befor every practice. this thinking help me to secceed. If I lose a game I don’t cry
I try to take the good things from the bad game, this is not help me if I cry all the time. 2. I had a
important text befor 3 years I remember this text all the time, beacuse that I got a high score,
because I learned alot before this text, this text all the time in my memory because the way was
very difficulte, I thought good befor the text, and I secceded I all the time thought good and
positive. 3. I didn’t secceded in the first, text driving. I didn’t cry, I tried to learn from my
mistakes. In the second text driving I secceded beacuse I thought positive and I said to myself
that I good driver and I will secceed. From this exampls I can to learn that I you think good and
positive you secceed all the time. Also if you mistake or don’t secceed you must to take the
good and the positive from your mistakes. I can to say to the end that if you thought good and
positive and you learn to take all the positive things. You be enjoy and you will be fun and you
succeed, all the time, you need to learn from the mistakes. Thare arnet perfect people! Bielive
